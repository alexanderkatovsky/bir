This is the software component of a router that handles ARP, IP packet forwarding, PWOSPF, basic NAT (PAT), and very basic DHCP.  It also comes with a rudimentary HTTP interface for basic user interaction.  See the design document ('design') for further information.

It can be made as a software only system (VNS mode) for running with the TVNS (see the tvns folder and its README), or in CPU mode, for running with a hardware component.  See INSTALL for building instructions.
