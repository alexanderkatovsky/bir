  assignment.

  You have been assigned topology 8846 which looks like this:

  To connect to your topology, after compiling the stub code, invoke sr
  as follows:

  >./sr -t 8846 -s vns-2.stanford.edu

  Please verify that the IP addresses for the interfaces match those
  in this email!

  Your output upon connecting should look like this:

 <-- Ready to process packets -->

 Secondly, please verify that you can see packets arriving to your topology when you
 try and ping one of your router interfaces.  To do this, connect to your topology
 as described above and try and ping eth0 (IP: 171.67.241.25).

 $ ping 171.67.241.25

 If you see output from sr that looks like:

 *** -> Received packet of length 60
 *** -> Received packet of length 60
 *** -> Received packet of length 60

 everything is working!  If not, please email vns-support@lists.stanford.edu.

Good Luck!
